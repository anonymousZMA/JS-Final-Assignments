##Rock Paper Scissors
The rock paper scissors project is a classic game that is played between two players. In this project, the user plays against the computer. The user can choose either rock, paper, or scissors, and the computer generates a random choice. The winner is determined based on the game's rules, and the winner's score is incremented. The game continues until either the user or the computer reaches a predetermined score.
